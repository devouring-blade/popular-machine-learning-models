# introduction
the Perceptron is an algorithms for supervised learning of binary classifiers. it can be seem as a single unit of an artificial neural network and it also known as the prototype for neural nets.

it's a simplified model of a biological neuron and simulates the behavior of one cell. 
When an input is fed in, it can be considered as a signal. After going through the computation process, it reaches the activation function, where it decides whether the signal is strong enough to surpass a predefined threshold in order to activate or not.

# structure
it is a single layer neural network with the unit step function as an activation function.

It is similar to linear regression because both use a linear function.
