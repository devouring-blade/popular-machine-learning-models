# estimation
Similar to the linear regression model, we assume that the dependent variable (y) varies linearly with the independent variable (x), 
and we try to create a straight line that best fits the data. However, to address a classification problem where the output values are discrete, 
we pass the modelâ€™s output through a sigmoid function to map them to probabilities within the range (0, 1).
