A Decision Tree is a supervised learning model used for classification or regression. Its goal is to predict the value of a target variable based on input features.
- The decision tree splits the data into subsets based on the values of the features.
- Each node in the tree corresponds to a decision (or condition).
- Each branch from a node represents the outcome of that decision.
- The splitting process continues until a stopping condition is met (for example, maximum depth, minimum number of samples, or when all samples in a group have the same label).
- The leaf nodes of the tree contain the predicted value or class label.
