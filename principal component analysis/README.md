1. Objective
Find a new axis 𝑣 (unit vector) so that when projecting data 𝑥𝑖 onto it, the variance of the projected data is maximized.
Reduce dimensionality by keeping axes with the largest variance.

2. Data Standardization
Gaussian standardization: 𝑥𝑖 = (𝑥𝑖−mean(𝑥𝑖)) / std(𝑥𝑖).
After this step, mean(𝑥𝑖) = 0.
Meaning: centering data around the origin helps identify the “direction of maximum spread” and balances features with different ranges.

3. Projecting Data onto the New Axis
For one point: 𝑧𝑖 = 𝑣^𝑇.𝑥𝑖
For all data: 𝑍 = 𝑋.𝑣

4. Variance of Projected Data
Var(z) = (1/n).Σ(zi − z̄)²
After centering (μ=0): Var(z) = (1/n).Σ(zi²) = (1/n).(Xv)^T.(Xv) = v^T.A.v
where A = (1/n).X^T.X (covariance matrix)

5. Constrained Optimization
Maximize J(v) = v^T.A.v
Constraint: v^T.v = 1
Lagrangian: L(v, λ) = v^T.A.v − λ.(v^T.v − 1)
Derivative to find the extremum to maximize with respect to 𝑣: A.v = λ.v

6. Finding Eigenvalues & Eigenvectors
Equation: (A − λI)v = 0
Non-trivial solutions exist only if det(A − λI) = 0
Solve for λ (eigenvalues) and v (eigenvectors), then normalize v

7. Interpretation of Results
Eigenvector v = direction of the new axis
Eigenvalue λ = variance along that axis

8. Principal Components
Sort eigenvalues in descending order
Choose k eigenvectors with largest λ → Vk
Project data: Z = X · Vk
