This model has no weights; it simply stores all the input data we provide. 
Then, whenever it receives a new value, it compares it using the Euclidean distance to find the points closest to it. 
For a classification problem, the result is the label that occurs most frequently among the k nearest points, while for regression, it is the average of the labels.
