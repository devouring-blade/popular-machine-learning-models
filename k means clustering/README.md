KMeans is an unsupervised learning method (unlabeled data) that clusters data set into k diffirent clusters. 
each sample is assigned to the cluster with the nearest mean, end then the mean (centroids) and clusters are updated 
during an iterative optimization process.
### procedure
- update cluster labels: assign points to the nearest cluster center (centroid)
- update cluster centers: set center to the mean of each cluster
