# idea
for Support Vector Machine Linear: use a linear model and try to find a decision boundary (hyperplane) that best separates data. the best hyperplane is the one that yields the largest separation/margin between both classes. so we choose the hyperplane so that the distance from it to the nearest datapoint on each size is maximined.
